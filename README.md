# 🧠 Maze Solver – AI Project

A mini AI project that finds the **shortest path through a maze** using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm — built for the *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* course.

---

## 🚀 What It Does
This Python program takes a maze in grid form and uses BFS to intelligently explore paths from the **start point** to the **goal**, returning the most optimal solution.

It’s a clean, beginner-friendly implementation that shows how simple logic can solve complex problems.
